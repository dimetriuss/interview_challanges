The interview question was:
Create a method which will be able to return just that values from integers range so their sqrt's will be integers.

In the is_sqrt_integer.py you can find possible solution.

In the test_sqrt_of_numbers_are_integers.py you will find possible tests examples which are written with usage
of unittest module.
To run them you need to navigate to:
$ cd your_path_to/interview_challenges
Run:
$  python -m unittest discover if_sqrt_of_integer_numbers_in_range_are_integers -v
