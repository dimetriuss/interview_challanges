A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller
natural numbers. (can be divided just on 1 or itself)

Possible interview questions:
Can you create the method to print N prime numbers from range?
Can you find Nth prime number from numbers range?


In the prime_number.py you can find prime number search method:
1) Iterative method
2) Math method via Eratosthenes sieve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

In the test_prime_numbers_search.py you will find possible tests examples which are written with usage of unittest module.
To run them you need to navigate to:
$ cd your_path_to/interview_challenges
Run:
$  python -m unittest discover prime_numbers -v

Note: take a look at the test_which_method_to_find_primes_is_faster_on_great_number_ranges and play with upper_number
value. When upper_number value is low for both methods - iterative way commonly win on my interpreter
(I've tried 10 attempts - in 8 of them iterative method was faster), but when
upper_number value is 10K, 100K, 1M - you will see the difference and power of math)) - Eratosthenes sieve will be
the winner and will save a lot of time.
