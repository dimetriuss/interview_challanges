The interview question was:
Given a string "aabddzxxggg" implement a Run Length Encoder and Decoder of this.
The RLE is of the form "NC" where N is the number of times character C occurs, e.g.:
1) encoder: "aabddzxxggga" -> "2a1b2d1z2x3g1a"
2) decoder: "2a1b2d1z2x3g1a" -> "aabddzxxggga"

In the rle_encoder.py you can find possible solutions:
1) With 're' module usage
2) Native way

In the test_rle_encoder.py you will find possible tests examples which are written with usage
of unittest module.
To run them you need to navigate to:
$ cd your_path_to/interview_challenges
Run:
$ python -m unittest discover string_RLE_encoding_and_decoding -v
