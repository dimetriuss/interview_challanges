The interview question was:
Consider a staircase of size n=4:
   #
  ##
 ###
####
Observe that its base and height are both equal to n, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces.
The last line is not preceded by any spaces. Write a program that prints a staircase of size n, where 0 < n <= 100


In the staircase.py you can find possible solution.

In the test_staircase.py you will find possible tests examples which are written with usage of unittest module.
To run them you need to navigate to:
$ cd your_path_to/interview_challenges
Run:
$ python -m unittest discover staircase -v
